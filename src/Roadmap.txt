Local (startup)
  -> State [ [id, rev], ... ]

Local (startup, and when notes are modified)
  <- Sync [ {note}, ... ]
    Conflicts handled in the UI here
  -> Sync [ {note}, ... ] // all notes with local props
  <- State [ [id, rev], ... ]
    Local updates rev on notes so long as they have no local props
